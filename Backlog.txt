Web Design:
- Create Achievement Search page (MERAVIGLIA) ðŸ’š
    to search for achievements by title, employer or by TAGS!
    - Add a modal for tag selection (TOP) ðŸ’š
    - Implement search by title and description (FAVOLA) ðŸ’š
- Create an Achiever page
    to display details about a person with achievements
- Create employer component
    to display next to every achievement that has an employer
- Create an arrow component for the splash screen
    to lightly incentivise a user to scroll down

Bugs:
- Why isn't the footer in linkbar transparent?

Optimisations:
- Fix RouterLink on components
- Redesign Data query structure (store achievment list in session data maybe)

Styles:
- Fix those f***ing colours goddamnit! They're hideous! XD
