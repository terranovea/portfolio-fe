Web Design:
- Create Achievement Search page (MERAVIGLIA) ðŸ’š
    to search for achievements by title, employer or by TAGS!
    - Add a modal for tag selection (TOP) ðŸ’š
    - Implement search by title and description (FAVOLA) ðŸ’š
    - Add Achiever selection (DONE) ðŸ’š
    - Rename to Search?
- Create an Achiever page
    to display details about a person with achievements
    - Migrate HomePage to AchieverPage (YAS) ðŸ’š
    - Create new simple HomePage with temporary link to Josh (Achiever) ðŸ’š
- Create employer component
    to display next to every achievement that has an employer

Bugs:
- Why isn't the footer in linkbar transparent?

Optimisations:
- Fix RouterLink on components
- Redesign Data query structure (store achievment list in session data maybe)

Order:
- replace null return values with custom Error Type for dbService to handle and display errors

Styles:
- Fix those f***ing colours goddamnit! They're hideous! XD
