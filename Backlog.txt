Web Design:
- Add coloured toasts to create-achievemen
    that depend on field validation
- Add profile navigation in account menu
- Add a clickable + tag to create new tags
- Create employer component
    to display next to every achievement that has an employer

Bugs:
- Why isn't the footer in linkbar transparent?

Optimisations:
- Fix RouterLink on components
- Redesign Data query structure (store achievment list in session data maybe)

Order:
- replace null return values with custom Error Type for dbService to handle and display errors

Styles:
- Fix those f***ing colours goddamnit! They're hideous! XD
