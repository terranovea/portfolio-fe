Web Design:
- Implement specific working validation on create-achievement (maybe after backend is developped)
- Add a clickable + tag to create new tags
- Implement achievement editing
- Implement profile editing
- Create employer component
    to display next to every achievement that has an employer (maybe superfluous)

Bugs:
- Why isn't the footer in linkbar transparent?

Optimisations:
- Redesign Data query structure (store achievment list in session data maybe)

Order:
- replace null return values with custom Error Type for dbService to handle and display errors

Styles:
- Fix those f***ing colours goddamnit! They're hideous! XD
